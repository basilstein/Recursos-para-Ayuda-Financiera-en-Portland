	<h1>About</h1>   
	<p>This website is dedicated to high school students in Portland, whose native language is either English or Spanish, that are looking for information regarding applying for financial aid. In our experience, information surrounding applying for financial aid and scholarships is purposefully vague and often difficult to navigate. Therefore, our goal is to make financial aid applications most relevant to students in Portland as accesible to them as possible.</p>
