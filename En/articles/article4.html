	<h1>Oregon Promise</h1>
	<p>Oregon Promise is a state grant that offsets the tuition cost of community college for Oregon residents, up to 90 credits. To be eligible, you must graduate high school with at least a 2.5 cumulative GPA or get at least 145 on all GED tests, and you must have been an Oregon resident for a year and be attending a community college in Oregon. Eligibility also depends on <a href = "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/how-calculated#efc">Expected Family Contribution</a>, and the limit for an applicant’s EFC will be finalized in July.</p>
	<p>To apply, you need to submit an Oregon Promise application through the OSAC Student Portal and submit the FAFSA or ORSAA. You usually need to apply during your senior year before you graduate or immediately after your GED test.</p>
