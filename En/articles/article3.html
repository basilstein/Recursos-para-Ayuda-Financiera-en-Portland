	<p>What is <a href="https://oregonstudentaid.gov/">OSAC</a>?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>OSAC has a myriad of applications and programs specifically for prospective college students in Oregon, it is therefore essential that students consider OSAC programs while thinking about both financial aid and scholarships; importantly: they administrate the ORSAA.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Do I need to file out the<a href="https://oregonstudentaid.gov/osac-doc/orsaa-guide.pdf">ORSAA</a>?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ORSAA is an alternative to the FAFSA specifically for undocumented and DACA individuals. You should not complete it if you are a US citizen.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Essentially, there are the <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/scholarships/apply.html">PCC Foundation scholarships</a>, as well as external scholarships which PCC reccomends you apply to.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To apply to the PCC Foundation scholarships, you just need to complete the financial aid application and create a MyPCC account, and complete desired scholarships before March 1st.</li>
		<li>With regard to external scholarships, PCC encourages students to apply to OSAC scholarships, as well as other common Scholarship websites such as Scholarship America.</li>
		<li>PCC emphasizes that external scholarship applications should be completed in the Winter to best accomadate the PCC schedule.</li>
