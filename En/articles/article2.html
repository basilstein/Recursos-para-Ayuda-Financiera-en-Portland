	<h2>PCC Scholarship</h2>
	<p>What is the purpose of <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/scholarships/">this</a> site</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To guide PCC students to complete scholarships relevant to the college, unfortunately it is long and overcomplicates things.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Essentially, there are the <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/scholarships/apply.html">PCC Foundation scholarships</a>, as well as external scholarships which PCC reccomends you apply to.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To apply to the PCC Foundation scholarships, you just need to complete the financial aid application and create a MyPCC account, and complete desired scholarships before March 1st.</li>
		<li>With regard to external scholarships, PCC encourages students to apply to OSAC scholarships, as well as other common Scholarship websites such as Scholarship America.</li>
		<li>PCC emphasizes that external scholarship applications should be completed in the Winter to best accomadate the PCC schedule.</li>
