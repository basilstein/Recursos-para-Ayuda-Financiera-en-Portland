	<h1>Federal Work Study</h1>
	<p>Undergraduate students can apply to work a part-time job during the school year to help offset tuition, housing, and related costs. Students can be hired by the college they’re attending, public agencies, or private organizations, and the jobs are subsidized by the federal government. They usually relate to what the student is studying and often involve community service work.</p>
	<p>For more information, you can visit <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html">this page</a> from the US Department of Education. Portland State University’s <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-aid/student-employment">website</a> also has information about student employment.</p>
